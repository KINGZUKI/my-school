 <h1>This my school.</h1>
 <p>I go to the school everday. Mon-Fri</p>

 <p>Welcome to <b>Castle Academy</b><br> It is our belief that each individual pupil should receive an education that is rich in terms of knowledge, skills concepts and relationships, developing the ability to challenge and communicate as well as supporting the individual in developing self-confidence and self-belief.  We educate our pupils to reach their full potential in an inclusive, happy and secure environment</p>
    <p>Castle...Never Stops Learning Our aim is simple, to offer an outstanding education for the pupils in partnership with Parents and Governors. It is our belief that each individual pupil should receive an education that is rich in terms of knowledge, skill.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, pupils and staff of Castle Academy celebrated the King' coronation in style! Celebrations began at lunch time with Aspens providing a roya menu of a British Roast Dinner and a King's Trifle. This was followed in the afternoon with the children enjoying 'coronation cakes',
            which they ate together 'tea party style' in their year groups. It was then time for
            the whole school to go into the hall, where our Castle Academy choir sang the
            song 'King's Coronation' to everyone. Finally, it was time for everyone to enjoy a
            theatrical performance of the classic British novel, The Jungle Book, performed for
            us by M&M Productions. Everyone had a fantastic afternoon with a celebration to remember.</p>

            <p>Last term our school council asked all of the children in school how they would like
                to find out more about our school governors. Our children responded by voting for
                the opportunity to meet governors and ask them questions about their role. Last
                Friday, that is exactly what happened as we were visited by David Hood, our Chair
                of Governors.David visited classes in Reception, Year 2, Year 3 and Year 5. The children were all
                excited to have David visit their classroom and were very welcoming. All classes
                had worked hard to prepare questions to ask David about his role as Chair of
                Governors, what the job entails, what governors are responsible for in school, how
                he finds out how the school is performing, and how he and the rest of the
                governing board support Mr Lugg and Mrs McIntyre in continuing to take the
                school from strength to strength. Dahl class (Year 3), led by Ugnius, did a
                particularly good job as they organised their questions into a PowerPoint for David
                to answer.</p>

                <h2>A royal assembly...</h2>

                <p>Today we had a whole school assembly informing the children about the
                    coronation. Prior to the assembly, Mr Wieremiej asked each year group to research
                    a question linked to the coronation, and then produce a couple of PowerPoint
                    slides that explain the answers to the questions. Mr Wieremiej then combined the
                    slides into one PowerPoint presentation that was shared in this morning's
                    assembly.</p>

                Children from each year group presented their findings to the school and all spoke
                very clearly- we were very proud of how brave they were in speaking in front of so
                many people.></p>
